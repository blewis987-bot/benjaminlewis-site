    <h1>Start here</h1>

    <p>
      This site is a quiet archive of systems, tools, and writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of what I build lives at the intersection of work, technology, and personal agency.
      If something here is useful, take it. If not, feel free to move on.

    <p>
      There is no feed. No funnel. No urgency.
